### Collection of useful configuration scripts for Ubuntu virtual machines on VirtualBox.
=================================================================================

#### Motivation

I have recently found myself using virtual machines as a quick way of setting up a development environment, without having to worry about clashes between project dependencies. Whilst setting these up, I found I was repeating a number of steps at the start of every installation. These scripts aim to reduce that repetition.

#### Usage

All of the scripts are presented as bash scripts - you are encouraged to read and understand them before running.

##### To use them

```

clone this repo to your virtual machine
cd virtual-machine-scripts
chmod u+x \*.sh

```
